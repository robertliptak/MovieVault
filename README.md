### ðŸš€ How to Run the Project

This project consists of a React frontend and an Express backend.

#### ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites

- Install Node.js
- Run npm install in both client/ and server/ folders

#### âš¡ Run the App

To start both the frontend and backend together, run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will:

- Start the React client (client/) on http://localhost:5173

Alternatively, you can start them separately:

```bash
npm run server  # Start Express backend
npm run client  # Start React frontend
```
